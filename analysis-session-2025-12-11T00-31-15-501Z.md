## Key Issues Identified

### 1. ZZ Pattern - NOT a ZZ Round (Activation Failed)

ZZ was supposed to skip if last run was negative, but it kept betting on run length 2 and losing every time.

**ZZ Performance Breakdown:**

| Run Length | Trades | Wins | Losses | P&L |
|------------|--------|------|--------|-----|
| Run Length 1 | 7 | **7** | 0 | **+808** |
| Run Length 2 | 10 | 0 | **10** | **-1020** |
| **Total** | 17 | 7 | 10 | **-212** |

**Critical Finding:** ZZ won 100% on run length 1, lost 100% on run length 2. The skip logic after negative run didn't work.

### 2. AntiZZ Did Not Activate

While ZZ was losing on run length 2 repeatedly:
- AntiZZ remained in "observing" state
- AntiZZ should have activated to counter ZZ losses
- Final AntiZZ state: `"state": "observing"` with cumulative profit in observation

### 3. 3-Block Break Issues

**Rule:** After 2 consecutive losses, skip trading for 3 blocks

**Problem:** Break was inconsistent:
- Sometimes skipped 1 block
- Sometimes skipped 2 blocks
- Rarely skipped full 3 blocks

**Consecutive Loss Triggers Found:**

| Trigger | Trade #s | Losses | What Happened |
|---------|----------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | 9-10 | -56, -152 | Took 2 trades during break: +128, -90 |
| 2 | 12-13 | -90, -162 | Skipped 2, took 1 loss: -44 |
| 3 | 42-43 | -200, -46 | Took trade 44: -136 |
| 4 | 54-55 | -106, -134 | Took trade 56: -24 |
| 5 | 59-60 | -58, -112 | Gap, then trade 61: +40 |
| 6 | 62-63 | -44, -90 | Gap, then trade 64: -178 |

**Impact:**
- Break skipped winning blocks (~80% avg) more than losing blocks
- Only prevented ~1 losing block in entire session
- Opportunity cost: ~80% per winning block missed

### 4. B&S (Bait & Switch) Pattern Confusion

Some trades showed `[B&S]` instead of `[MAIN]`:
- Trade 21: `2A2 [B&S]` → WIN +150
- Trade 24: `2A2 [B&S]` → LOSS -162

Questions to investigate:
- When does pattern switch to B&S mode?
- Why inconsistent labeling?

## Summary

**Session was profitable (+1,568) DESPITE these bugs:**

1. **ZZ skip logic failure** - Lost -1020 on run length 2 trades that should have been skipped
2. **AntiZZ never activated** - Should have countered ZZ losses
3. **3-block break inconsistent** - Skipped winning opportunities more than losses
4. **B&S mode confusion** - Unclear triggering

**Potential improvement:** With proper ZZ skip and AntiZZ activation, session could have been +2,500 to +3,000.
